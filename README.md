# clair3-nanopore

This repository is being written collaboratively as part of a tutorial.
Eventually it will hold complete instructions for the following steps:

- concatenating reads with a custom function
- aligning reads with minimap2
- variant calling with clair3
- manipulating clair3 outputs to contain variant calls for variants of interest
- reformatting output vcf files for compatibility with SNPEff
